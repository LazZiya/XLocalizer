All product and company names of translation services are trademarks™ or registered® trademarks of their respective holders. Use of them does not imply any affiliation with or endorsement by them.

During the development of `XLocalizer` I've used many online translation services with the freemium plan, but it is up to you to use a priced plan from the respective service.

 Each translation service has its pros and cons. [MyMemory Translate][1] provided the best results for the languages I've been working with _(in terms performans and amount of free translation requests)_. So, in this documentation you will see most samples refering to [MyMemory Translate][1] as the translation service. But you are free to use any other service that fits your needs.
